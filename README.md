# Free RSS Reader
 Straightforward RSS feed reader written in VB.<span></span>NET

I remember being annoyed when Google canceled Reader, and at the time I was on a Windows 7 computer, so I fired up what I had in front of me (Visual Studio Code), poked around on MSDN for a while and wrote my own reader program to use on my desktop. This is designed to fetch RSS feeds on the web, display their short descriptions in a webbrowser control, and then open the links in the system default browser if the user clicks any of the links. It includes Save/Open routines so the user can keep separate lists of RSS feeds.

As of this latest commit, it's tested and working on Windows 7 x64 with the .NET 4.6 framework.
